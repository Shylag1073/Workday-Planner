Welcome to my day planner! this application shows you today's date and current time. You have a layout of a typical work hours from 9am to 4pm. Hour slots are color coded so you can know which is present, past, or future. Don't worry if you computer crashes, all of your plans will be backed up on your local storage.


please enjoy!
